## ⚙️ Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Minimum Version |
|---|---|
| Node.js | ≥ 18.x |
| npm | ≥ 9.x |
| Python | ≥ 3.10 |
| pip | Latest |
| Git | ≥ 2.40 |

### 1. Fork & Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/CyberDefenseX_Ultra.git
cd CyberDefenseX_Ultra

# Add the upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/cyberhub2025/CyberDefenseX_Ultra.git
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy the environment template and fill in your keys
cp .env.example .env
```

**Required environment variables (`backend/.env`):**

```env
NVIDIA_API_KEY=your_nvidia_nim_api_key_here
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
SECRET_KEY=a_strong_random_secret_key
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=optional_for_oauth
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=optional_for_oauth
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=optional_for_oauth
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=optional_for_oauth
```

```bash
# Start the backend server with auto-reload
python app.py
# → API server running at http://localhost:8000
# → Swagger docs at http://localhost:8000/docs
```

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install

# Set the backend URL
echo "REACT_APP_BACKEND_API_URL=http://localhost:8000" > .env
```

```bash
npm start
# → React dev server running at http://localhost:3000
```

### 4. Verify Everything Works

- Open `http://localhost:3000` — the landing page should load
- Open `http://localhost:8000/docs` — FastAPI Swagger UI should appear
- Log in and navigate to the **Overview** dashboard — charts should populate

> [!TIP]
> You can test the RLE engine without a live syslog feed by appending raw HTTP log lines to `backend/input.log`. The engine polls for new lines every second.

---

## 🌿 Branch Strategy & Workflow

We follow a **feature-branch workflow** off of `main`.

```
main          ← Protected. Only merged via reviewed PRs.
  └── feat/my-new-feature      ← Your working branch
  └── fix/bug-description
  └── docs/update-readme
  └── refactor/module-name
  └── test/coverage-improvement
  └── chore/dependency-update
```

### Step-by-Step Workflow

```bash
# 1. Always start from an up-to-date main
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# 2. Create your feature branch
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name

# 3. Make your changes...

# 4. Stage and commit using the convention below
git add .
git commit -m "feat(rle): add SSRF attack pattern detection"

# 5. Sync with upstream before pushing
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main

# 6. Push your branch
git push origin feat/your-feature-name

# 7. Open a Pull Request on GitHub
```

> [!WARNING]
> **Never commit directly to `main`.** All changes must go through a Pull Request and receive at least **1 approval** from a core maintainer.

---

## ✍️ Commit Message Convention

We use **[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)** to keep the history clean and automated changelogs possible.

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

| Type | When to Use |
|---|---|
| `feat` | A new feature |
| `fix` | A bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only changes |
| `style` | Formatting, missing semicolons (no logic change) |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring without changing behavior |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `chore` | Dependency updates, tooling, CI config |
| `perf` | Performance improvements |
| `security` | Security patches or hardening |

### Scopes

Use the module name as scope: `rle`, `blockchain`, `ai`, `dashboard`, `auth`, `sse`, `report`, `api`, `frontend`, `ci`

### Examples

```bash
feat(rle): add SSRF detection pattern to log engine
fix(blockchain): prevent duplicate block mining on rapid alerts
docs(api): add missing endpoint docs for /alerts/status
refactor(ai): extract NVIDIA NIM request logic into helper
security(auth): enforce PKCE for OAuth2 authorization code flow

## 🎨 Frontend Contribution Guide

The frontend is a **React 18 SPA** using `HashRouter` (required for GitHub Pages), Recharts, React-Leaflet, and a glassmorphic design system.

### Key Principles

- **Component-first**: Every new UI element should be a focused, reusable component
- **Design system compliance**: Use existing CSS variables from `src/index.css` — do not hardcode colors or font sizes
- **SSE-awareness**: Real-time data comes from `useEventStream` — subscribe to the correct event types (`alerts.changed`, `logs.received`, `notifications.new`)
- **Dark/Light theme**: All styles must work in both themes using CSS `var()` tokens

### Adding a New Page

1. Create `src/pages/YourPage.js` and `src/pages/YourPage.css`
2. Register the route in `src/App.js`
3. Add the nav entry in `src/components/Sidebar.js`
4. Follow the existing page structure (header, content area, responsive grid)

### CSS Guidelines

```css
/* ✅ DO — Use design system variables */
.my-card {
  background: var(--glass-bg);
  border: 1px solid var(--glass-border);
  border-radius: var(--radius-lg);
  color: var(--text-primary);
}

/* ❌ DON'T — Hardcode values */
.my-card {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
  border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
  border-radius: 12px;
  color: #ffffff;
}
```

### Chart Components (Recharts)

When adding new charts, follow the established pattern in `Overview.js` and `Vulnerabilities.js`:
- Use `ResponsiveContainer` for all chart wrappers
- Apply theme colors from CSS variables via `stroke` and `fill` props
- Provide a `CustomTooltip` component for branded tooltip styling

## 🐍 Backend Contribution Guide

The backend is a **FastAPI** async application with SQLite databases, SSE event broadcasting, and a blockchain integrity layer.

### Key Architecture Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| `AsyncGenerator` SSE endpoints | Keeps connections alive without blocking the event loop |
| `event_bus.py` pub/sub | Decouples producers (RLE, blockchain) from SSE consumers |
| `alerts_cache.py` | Reduces SQLite reads on hot endpoints — always update the cache when mutating alerts |
| `app_data.db` vs `users.db` | Security isolation — user credentials are never in the same DB as operational data |

### Adding a New API Endpoint

```python
# In app.py — follow this pattern:
@app.get("/your-resource", tags=["Your Tag"])
async def get_your_resource(
    limit: int = Query(100, ge=1, le=1000),
    # other typed params...
):
    """
    Brief description of what this endpoint returns.
    
    - **limit**: Maximum number of items to return
    """
    try:
        # ... implementation
        return {"status": "success", "data": result}
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to fetch your resource: {e}")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Internal server error")
```

### SSE Event Publishing

When your backend change should trigger a real-time frontend update:

```python
from event_bus import publish

# Publish after mutating state
await publish("alerts.changed", {"source": "your-module", "count": len(alerts)})
```

### Database Guidelines

- Always use parameterized queries — **never string-format SQL**
- Close connections in `finally` blocks
- Validate and sanitize all user-supplied input before any DB operation
- New tables should be created in `app_data.db` (not `users.db`) unless they're user identity data

## ⛓️ Blockchain Module Guide

The blockchain layer is a **custom SHA-256 hash chain** with Merkle tree verification. This is a high-sensitivity module.

### Architecture

```
Leader Node (backend/Blockchain/leader/)
  ├── blockchain.py   ← Mine blocks, verify chain, manage workers
  ├── broadcast.py    ← Watch alerts.xlsx for changes → broadcast new blocks
  └── blockchain.json ← The canonical ledger (never edit manually)

Worker Node (backend/Blockchain/worker/)
  ├── blockchain.py   ← Replicate chain from leader, run integrity checks
  └── worker_blockchain.json ← Worker's local chain copy
```

### Rules for Blockchain Contributions

> [!CAUTION]
> Modifying the mining logic, hash functions, or Merkle tree implementation can silently corrupt the entire chain. All such changes require:
> - A detailed explanation in the PR description
> - A reproducible test case showing the chain remains valid before and after
> - Explicit review by a core maintainer

- **Do not** change the block schema without a migration plan
- **Do not** modify `blockchain.json` or `worker_blockchain.json` directly in commits
- **Do** write unit tests for any new verification logic
- **Do** document the cryptographic rationale for any algorithm change

## 🤖 AI Assistant Module Guide

The AI module (`backend/ai.py`) interfaces with **NVIDIA NIM API** (default: `gpt-oss-120b`) and includes a local fallback for offline operation.

### Adding New AI Capabilities

1. New prompt templates should live in clearly named constants at the top of `ai.py`
2. Context injection (alert data, blockchain state) must be **size-bounded** — never send unbounded data to the API
3. All API calls must have retry logic and graceful degradation to the local fallback
4. User inputs must be sanitized before inclusion in prompts (prevent prompt injection)

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `NVIDIA_API_KEY` | Authentication for NVIDIA NIM API |
| `NVIDIA_MODEL` | (Optional) Override default model name |

---

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

### Backend Testing

```bash
cd backend
pip install pytest pytest-asyncio httpx

# Run tests
pytest tests/ -v
```

For new backend features, include:
- **Unit tests** for pure functions (detection patterns, hash functions, data parsers)
- **Integration tests** for new API endpoints using `httpx.AsyncClient`

### Frontend Testing

```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

For new frontend components, include:
- **Render tests** — does the component mount without errors?
- **Interaction tests** — do click handlers, filters, and state changes work?

### RLE Engine Testing

The RLE engine can be tested by writing crafted HTTP log lines to `input.log`. A test log generator template:

```bash
# SQL Injection test
echo '192.168.1.100 - - [03/May/2026:12:00:00 +0000] "GET /search?q=UNION+SELECT+1,2,3-- HTTP/1.1" 200 1234' >> backend/input.log

# Brute Force simulation (paste 5+ times rapidly)
echo '10.0.0.5 - - [03/May/2026:12:00:01 +0000] "POST /login HTTP/1.1" 401 89' >> backend/input.log
```

## 🎨 Style Guides

### Python (Backend)

- Follow **[PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)** — use `black` for auto-formatting
- Use **type hints** on all function signatures
- Write **docstrings** for all public functions and classes
- Maximum line length: **120 characters**

```bash
# Auto-format before committing
pip install black
black backend/
```

### JavaScript / React (Frontend)

- Follow **[Airbnb React/JSX Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react)**
- Use **functional components** with hooks — no class components
- Prefer **named exports** over default exports for components
- Keep component files **under 400 lines** — split large components
- Use `const` by default, `let` only when reassignment is needed

```bash
# Lint before committing
cd frontend
npm run lint
```

### CSS

- Use **BEM-like naming** for component-specific classes: `.threats-table__row--critical`
- All new CSS variables must be defined on `:root` in `index.css`
- Mobile-first responsive design with breakpoints at `768px` and `1200px`
- No `!important` — structure your selectors properly

### Git

- Keep commits atomic — one logical change per commit
- Rebase rather than merge when updating your branch
- Delete your feature branch after the PR is merged
